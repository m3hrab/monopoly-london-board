## Description

Monopoly London is a thrilling adaptation of the classic Monopoly game, set in the bustling streets of the vibrant city of London. Immerse yourself in the rich history and iconic landmarks of this world-famous city as you buy, sell, and trade your way to become a property tycoon.

## How to Play

1. **Setup**: Gather 2 to 6 players, choose your favorite game piece, and place all players' pieces on the "Go" space. Each player starts with a set amount of money.

2. **Taking Turns**: Players take turns rolling the dice and moving their game piece clockwise around the board. The number on the dice indicates the number of spaces to move.

3. **Property Purchase**: When landing on an unowned property, you have the option to purchase it for the listed price. If you choose not to buy, the property will be auctioned to the highest bidder.

4. **Collecting Rent**: When other players land on a property you own, they must pay you rent according to the property's value and any improvements you've made.

5. **Chance and Community Chest**: Draw cards from the Chance and Community Chest decks, which can lead to unexpected windfalls or setbacks.

6. **Building Houses and Hotels**: As you collect full sets of properties of the same color, you can build houses and later hotels on them. This increases the rent other players must pay when landing on your properties.

7. **Jail**: If you land on the "Jail" space, you'll be "Just Visiting." However, if you roll doubles three times in a row or draw a "Go to Jail" card, you'll be sent to jail and must try to roll doubles to get out.

8. **Free Parking**: The "Free Parking" space is a resting point with no additional benefits or penalties.

9. **Bankruptcy**: If a player runs out of money and can't pay rent, taxes, or other fees, they are declared bankrupt. Their properties and assets are then auctioned off.

10. **Winning**: The last player remaining after all others have gone bankrupt is the winner and the new London property tycoon!
