Issue: unable to move player token into currect position based the on dice value

Explaination: 
    In pygame we know that the every elements in pygame has position based on screens cordinate .
    so, every elements in the game has a position(x,y). Similar that player tokens also have position 
    In the begining of the game, players tokens position(x,y) is bottom-right corner of the board. When player
    roll the dice. we use the dice value and multiply the with gap to the set tokens x position. So that,
    the player tokens moves it's current position. When tokens x positon is equal or graten then the board
    bottom-left position. then we update the tokens y position so that the token can move bottom to top based 
    on the dice value. and Similar to the other corner as well 

    Because of the Monopoly Board that i design earlier is not pixel perfect and most importantly some property cards
    are not the same size that's why the player tokens position sometimes gone wrong.

    Although try to solve by adding some if-else codition to adjust the tokens correct position but 
    error raised when dice value is greater than the tokens right/left/top/bottom corner of the board.
    the tokens cannot swith the tokens moving direction because of hard-coded adjustment that i try to do. 
    that's why i cann't calculate the left/right tokens moves and the remains up/down move for the token.

How i plan to solve it : just design board with exact same size properties card.(but after doing that Some property split in multilne or make it smaller font size)
                    but also takes time. That i already used :'(
