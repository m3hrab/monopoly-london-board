Set up the board:

Arrange the board and all the pieces.
Shuffle the Chance and Community Chest cards and place them in their designated spots on the board.
Randomly determine who will go first.
Each player starts with a set amount of money and places their token on the "GO" space.
Begin the first turn:

The first player rolls the dice and moves their token clockwise around the board.
If the player lands on an unowned property, they can choose to buy it at the listed price.
If the player lands on a property owned by another player, they must pay rent to that player based on the property's value and any buildings on it.
If the player lands on a "Chance" or "Community Chest" space, they draw a card and follow the instructions on it.
If the player lands on "Go to Jail" space, they must immediately go to jail.
After the first turn:

Play continues in turn order, with each player rolling the dice and moving their token around the board.
Players can buy properties, build houses and hotels, and collect rent from other players who land on their properties.
If a player lands on an unowned property, they can choose to buy it at the listed price.
If a player lands on a property owned by another player, they must pay rent to that player based on the property's value and any buildings on it.
Going to jail:

If a player rolls doubles three times in a row, they must go to jail.
A player can also be sent to jail by landing on the "Go to Jail" space, drawing a "Go to Jail" card, or by rolling too many times to get out of jail.
A player in jail can try to roll doubles to get out of jail, or pay a fine to get out early.
If the player doesn't roll doubles or pay the fine, they must wait three turns before being released from jail.
Winning the game:

The game continues until one player owns all the properties or all the other players have gone bankrupt.
The player with the most money and assets at the end of the game is the winner.
